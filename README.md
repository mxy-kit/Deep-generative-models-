## ðŸ“‚ Contents

### 1. Bayesian Regression with ARD
Implementation of regression with Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD), applying Bayesian methods for feature relevance analysis.  
File: `bayesian_ard_regression.ipynb`

---

### 2. Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
Implementation of Autoencoder (AE), Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and Conditional VAE (CVAE). Trained on MNIST dataset, compared reconstructions and generations.
